Enhanced Security: Object counting enhances security and surveillance by accurately tracking and counting entities, aiding in proactive threat detection. </br>
Informed Decision-Making: Object counting offers valuable insights for decision-making, optimizing processes in retail, traffic management, and various other domains. </br>

## Object Counting using YOLOv8n and Ultralytics

This repository contains Python code for object counting using YOLOv8n (an optimized version of YOLO - You Only Look Once) from Ultralytics, a computer vision library, along with a solution for object counting provided by Ultralytics.

### Overview

Object counting is a crucial task in various applications such as traffic monitoring, retail analytics, and crowd management. This code provides a solution to count objects of specified classes (e.g., persons, cars) in a video stream using YOLOv8n for object detection and Ultralytics for object counting.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Ultralytics library
- Pre-trained YOLOv8n model (yolov8n.pt)
- Input video file (e.g., .mp4 format)

### Usage

1. **Setup Environment**: Make sure you have all the dependencies installed. You can install Ultralytics and OpenCV using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install ultralytics
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

2. **Download Pre-trained Model**: Obtain the YOLOv8n pre-trained model (yolov8n.pt) and place it in the project directory.

3. **Prepare Input Video**: Place the input video file (e.g., .mp4 format) in the project directory.

4. **Configure Parameters**: Modify the code to set the appropriate parameters such as line or region points for counting, classes to count, and input/output file paths.

5. **Run the Code**: Execute the provided Python script. The script will read the input video, perform object detection using YOLOv8n, and count the specified object classes. The output will be a video with objects counted and annotated.

### Code Explanation counting_specific_class

- The code initializes YOLOv8n model for object detection and sets up a video capture from the input video file.
- It defines a line or region for counting objects and specifies the classes (e.g., persons, cars) to count.
- Video processing is performed frame by frame. YOLOv8n detects objects in each frame, and Ultralytics' object counter counts the specified classes.
- The counted objects are annotated on the video frames, and the processed frames are written to an output video file.
